#Raw data
  here the raw data is in the vascular data repository
  there is the images.txt, truths.txt, groups.txt and paths.txt files

  *the problem comes down to that it is difficult to make assumptions
  about raw data, so currently it can be anything which makes it hard to
  write reusable code.

  *The trick would be to map out different cases, e.g. csv file, db, ...

  *For SV we have a number of "cases" where each case has "files" associated
  with it and each case is processed independently to produce the processed
  data
    -single large CSV is really just 1 case with 1 file
    -could abstract this as list of case config files
      --each case config file has the relevant file paths in it
      --then write a function process_case(case_file,global_config)
    -Note that this is different from how I currently have it, separate config
    per case helps to keep cases independent from each other

*What is this process? Abstraction/identifying the elements
